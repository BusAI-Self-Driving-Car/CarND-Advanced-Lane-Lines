This repository contains my development of the [Project: Advanced Lane Lines](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines) proposed by the Udacity's Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree. Here you can see how it works on a real scenario:

This project goal is to develop a pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a real scenario. 

This is the advance version of the *Finding Lane Lines on the Road project* ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/rscova/CarND-LaneLines-P1))

The pipeline is based in 6 steps:
1. Camera Calibration: Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
2. Distortion Image Correction: Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
3. Color Spaces and Gradients Thresholds: Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image
4. Perspective transform: Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
5. Detect lane lines: Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
6. Determine the lane curvature: Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.

Extra:

7. Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image

8. Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

To achieve that I have implemented two clases: `ImageProcessor()` and `LineFinder()`. And some naive functions.

To understand this repository code, check first the `writeup.md` and `pipeline_step_by_step.ipynb`. These files have the pipeline explained step by step with the results of each part.

If you want to download the `test_videos/` and `camera_cal` folders with the videos and images to test the pipeline in videos and calibrate the camera from scratch you can do it from [Google Drive]()

### Objectives
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Test it in a short videos from the 280 highway of California, United States
* Reflect my work in a  <A HREF="https://github.com/rscova/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup.md" target="_blank"> written report</A>.

###  Requirements
*1.* This project use Python3 version.  If you don't have it installed, check out  https://www.python.org/downloads/ 

*2.* Install the requirement packages.
> pip3 install -r requirements.txt >
